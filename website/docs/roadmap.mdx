# Goals

The goals of smelt are to provide:

- Expressive test generation
- Easy failure reproduction
- Simplicity -- users should be able to run a testlist interactively without knowledge of smelt internals
- Modular runtimes -- running locally vs on a slurm should feel the same
- Expose coarse grained parallelism

## Non-goals

- Being a build system
- Sacrificing simplicty for performance

# Roadmap

Smelt is still a new tool -- we're actively adding features. Priority for feature work is as follows:

1. Slurm executor -- execute commands on slurm the same way you would locally
2. Passing arguments to procedural test lists -- this would allow end users to pass "seeds" or other such input to testlists, and would help with the ergonmoics of random test generation
3. Command Replay from Invocation object -- invocation messages should contain all of the information to replay a command
4. Restructure command interface -- currently we have this as two mirrored structures in python and rust, it would be best to move this to protobuf
5. Support for async test running -- workflows can be very lengthy, especially in EDA
6. REAPI Remote Caching of tests -- Add optional finger printing and remote caching for commands that declare inputs and outputs
7. Starlark rules -- Add a starlark interface to generate commands
