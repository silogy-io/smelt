Smelt is a task and test runner that aims to be a simple framework to declare, execute and analyze tests.

A goal of smelt is to make the task running mechanics as simple as possible; to achieve this each command under smelt creates a bash script that can be inspected, re-run, and modified.

Smelt is distributed as a python package -- you can install it via:

`pip install pysmelt`

Once smelt is installed, describe a test list using a simple [YAML][yaml] schema in a file called `test.smelt`:

```yaml title="test.smelt"
- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"
```

And call it by running `smelt execute test.smelt` from your terminal.

## Features

- [Procedural test generation](/getting-started): Programatically generate tests with python
- [Extensible](/writing-rules): Define your tests with a simple python interface
- [Rerun on failure ](/python-api): Describe the computation required re-run failing tests
- [Analyze tests](/analysis): Generic and sane API to analyze test results
