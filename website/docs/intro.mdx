Smelt is a simple and extensible task runner optimized for chip development
workflows. Smelt makes it easy to programmatically define arbitrarily many test
variants, run those tests in parallel, and analyze their results. Smelt
provides simple and efficient workflows to both localized and distributed
compute contexts.

Smelt is distributed as a python package and can be installed via:

`pipx install pysmelt`

With smelt installed, you can describe a test list using a simple [YAML][yaml]
schema in a file with a `.smelt` extension or procedurally with python.
A snippet ofba python testlist from [yves][yves]:

```py title="frontend_tl.py"
num_branches = 1024
bhist_iterations = 10000
branch_tests = []
for size in [2**n for n in range(12)]:
    # This rule compiles a file, and can be run in parallel
    benchmark = compile_local_ubench_zig(
        name=f"directional_branch_history_{size}",
        compiler_path=compiler_path,
        benchmark_path=branch_hist,
        ubench_parameters={
            "INNER_ITERATIONS": size,
            "ITERATIONS": bhist_iterations,
            "NUM_BRANCHES": num_branches,
        },
        compiler_target=cpp_compiler.as_ref,
    )
    bench_bin = benchmark.get_outputs()["binary"]
    # This is a test that benchmarks the local system, and should exhibit no parllelism, to avoid crosstalk
    bench = local_benchmark(
        name=f"directional_branch_history_{size}_local",
        profiler_path=profiler_bin,
        benchmark_path=bench_bin,
        metadata={
            "BRANCHES_OBSERVED": size * num_branches * bhist_iterations,
            "HISTORY": size,
        },
    )
    branch_tests.append(bench)
dbh = test_group(name="directional_branch_history_sweep", tests=branch_tests)
ftcg = test_group(name="all_frontend_tests", tests=[dbh.as_ref])
```

there is a hierarchal test group that depends on these tests and others:

```yaml title="all.smelt.yaml"
- name: all_tests
  rule: test_group
  rule_args:
    tests:
      - //benches/memory/loadtouse_tl.py:all_mem_tests
      - //benches/midcore/bandwidths_etc.py:all_mc_tests
      - //benches/frontend/frontend_tl.py:all_frontend_tests
```

Smelt will execute these tests with as much parallelism as possible:

## Features

Smelt is designed to make running multiple tasks as simple as possible. To
achieve this, each command under smelt creates a bash script that can be
inspected, re-run, and modified.

Built for EDA (electonic design automation), smelt seeks to unify the "best
practices" for testing infrastructure:

- Procedural test generation: Programatically generate tests with python
- Automatic rerun on failure: Describe the computation required re-run failing
  tests
- Analysis APIs: All of the data needed to track and reproduce tests
- Extensible: Define your tests with a simple python interface
