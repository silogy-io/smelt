Smelt is a task and test runner that aims to be a simple framework to declare, execute and analyze tests.

Smelt does this by providing an interface to define and run simple bash commands

Smelt is distributed as a python package -- you can install it via:

`pip install pysmelt`

Once smelt is installed, describe a test list using a simple [YAML][yaml] schema in a file called `test.smelt`:

```yaml title="test.smelt"
- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"
```

And call it by running `smelt execute test.smelt` from your terminal.

✨ wow you just executed your first test list ✨ stay a while, pour a drink will you...
