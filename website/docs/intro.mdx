Smelt is a simple and extensible task runner optimized for chip development
workflows. Smelt makes it easy to programmatically define arbitrarily many test
variants, run those tests in parallel, and analyze their results. Smelt
provides simple and efficient workflows to both localized and distributed
compute contexts.

Smelt is distributed as a python package and can be installed via:

`pip install pysmelt`

With smelt installed, you can describe a test list using a simple [YAML][yaml]
schema in a file with a `.smelt` extension:

```yaml title="test.smelt"
- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"
```

And call it by running `smelt execute test.smelt` from your terminal.

## Features

Smelt is designed to make running multiple tasks as simple as possible. To
achieve this, each command under smelt creates a bash script that can be
inspected, re-run, and modified.

Built for EDA (electonic design automation), smelt seeks to unify the "best
practices" for testing infrastructure:

- Procedural test generation: Programatically generate tests with python
- Automatic rerun on failure: Describe the computation required re-run failing
tests
- Analysis APIs: All of the data needed to track and reproduce tests
- Extensible: Define your tests with a simple python interface
