# Getting started

Go to the root of your project and create a file named `testlist.smelt.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash_build
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"

- name: say_bye
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "bye"
    deps:
      - say_hey
```

You can execute this testlist by executing `smelt execute testlist.smelt.yaml`. When a test list is executed, the following steps occur:

1. Each target creates a bash script in your project root, at path `smelt-out/{target_name}/command.sh`. For this example, there are two targets, `say_hey` and `say_bye`.
2. Each bash script is executed, honoring any dependencies between each target. If there are no dependencies between targets, then they can be executed in parallel.

One the goals (TODO: link) of smelt is simplicity -- any command that is run will map back to a shell script that can be executed interactively.
