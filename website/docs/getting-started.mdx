# Getting started

## Yaml test list

Go to the root of your project and create a file named `testlist.smelt.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
- name: say_hey
  rule: raw_bash_build
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "hey"

- name: say_bye
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "bye"
    deps:
      - say_hey
```

Execute this testlist by executing `smelt execute testlist.smelt.yaml`.

Each command generated in a test list is executed in the directory that the test list is declared

Smelt works by converting test lists to a series of bash commands, that are then executed by the smelt runtime

## Procedural test lists

Procedural testlists can be very useful, particularly for constrained random testing or directed testing sweeps (e.g. sweeping a test from low to high load)

smelt support procedural test generation using smelt's python interface; a simple example:

```python
procedural.py
# test name
from pysmelt.default_targets import raw_bash

for i in range(5):
    raw_bash(name=f"my_test_{i}",cmds=[f'echo "howdy partner from test {i}"']
```

executing this file with `smelt execute procedural.py`

```

           │ my_test_3    │ PASSED │ 0.01ms         │
           └──────────────┴────────┴────────────────┘
```

## Inspecting test results, manually

Each command that is executed in smelt creates a directory at path `${GIT_ROOT}/smelt-out/{COMMAND_NAME}`, that will hold the following files

- command.sh: The bash script that is executed to execute this command
- command.out: the combined stderr and stdout of this command.

The command will often generate outputs in this directory, but there is no enforcement of this policy.

## Inspecting test results, programatically

After executing a testlist, smelt will produce an invocation object at path `smelt-out/invocation.bin` that includes information on the commands that were just executed.

Smelt's python interface has convience methods to interact with this invocation object -- the object is defined as a protobuf message, defined in the [smelt-data][https://github.com/silogy-io/smelt/blob/dev/crates/smelt-data/executed_tests.proto#L65] crate.

For example, to inspect stdout from the `my_test_5` from the previous step, we could execute the following python script:

```python

from pysmelt.interfaces.analysis import IQL, TestResult
iql = IQL.from_previous()
log_content = iql.get_log_content()
if log_content:
    for line in log_content.split('\n'):
        print(line)

```

## Running commands under a docker container

You can run each command in a testlist under a docker container with `smelt execute-docker`.

For example, executing

## Non-local dependencies

You can declare dependencies to other testlists in your project, relative to the smelt root. An example of this can be seen in `yves`

```yaml
# file exists at ${GIT_ROOT}/download_zig.smelt.yaml
- name: "cpp_compiler"
  rule: download_zig
```

```yaml
# file exists at ${GIT_ROOT}/profilers/buildprof.smelt.yaml
- name: profiler
  rule: local_profiler
  rule_args:
    compiler_download: //download_zig.smelt.yaml:cpp_compiler
    mac_sources:
      - mac_profiler.c
      - cJSON.c
    linux_sources:
      - linux_profiler.c
      - cJSON.c
```

## Validating testlists

To validate that a testlist is well formed, without executing the tests, execute

```
smelt validate path/to/testlist.smelt.yaml
```

This will printout all the commands present in the test list

## Automatic rerun failing commands

Smelt supports automatic re-run of failing commands, if the [Target][Target] generates a rerun command

A command fails if it returns a nonzero exit code

For example, executing this test list

```
example.smelt.yaml
- name: cmark
  rule: raw_bash
  rule_args:
    cmds:
      - echo "normal"
      - exit 1
    debug_cmds:
      - echo "we are re-running now . crazy"

```

will execute two commands -- cmark, and cmark@rerun, after the previous command fails

For more complex rerun semantics -- e.g., rebuilding a binary with debug flags, and then running a new test with that binary, see details in the [internals][RerunInternals] page

## Creating new targets

Every example prior to this has used [default targets][DefaultRules] packaged with smelt

End users can define their own smelt targets in their own repo by defining classes that inherit from the [Target][Target] class in your `${GIT_ROOT}/smelt_rules` directory.

```python
# create this file in smelt_rules/seeded.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from pysmelt.interfaces import Target
from typing import List

@dataclass
class seeded_simulator_test(Target):
    seed: int
    simulator_bin: str

    def gen_script(self) -> List[str]:
        return [f"{self.simulator_bin} --seed {self.seed}"]

    def gen_rerun_script(self) -> Optional[List[str]]:
        return [f"{self.simulator_bin} --seed {self.seed} --verbose"]

```

Now you can use this new rule in test lists

```yaml
example.smelt.yaml
- name: seed_1000
  rule: seeded_simulator_test
  rule_args:
    seed: 1000
    simulator_bin: some_simulator


```

Then execute this testlist with with `smelt execute example.smelt.yaml`

or procedural test lists

```python
# created at path new_rule.py

from pysmelt.generators.procedural import init_local_rules
init_local_rules()
from seeded import seeded_simulator_test

simulator_bin = "some_simulator"
for i in range(50):
    seeded_simulator_test(name=f"seed_{i}, seed=i,simulator_bin=simulator_bin)
```

and `smelt execute new_rule.py`

## Using smelt as a library

Smelt can be used as a python library; here's an example of reading and executing a test list:

```python
from pysmelt.pygraph import PyGraph, create_graph, create_graph_with_docker

some_testlist = "testlist.smelt.yaml"
graph = create_graph(some_testlist)
graph.run_all_commands()

```
