# Glossary

This is a reference for foundational concepts in smelt, that are used throughout
the codebase and documentation

### Command

A command is the lowest level unit of work.

Each command describes:

- A bash script that describes all the work this command contains
- A `RuntimeRequirements` object to describe the CPU, memory, and timeout
requirements of this command
- A list of dependencies of other commands, that this command depends on

### Target

A target is python interface used to generate `Command`s. Each target can
generate up to three commands:

- the default command
- the re-run command -- is executed if the default command fails
- the rebuild command -- is executed if a dependent target's re-run command
fails

Test lists in smelt are composed of `Target`s, either yaml or python

### Rule

A rule is a common way of referring to a target definition -- this is inherited
from the bazel and buck nomenclature

### Smelt-root

smelt-root is the "root" to which all smelt paths are relative. By default,
smelt-root will be `$GIT_ROOT`

### smelt path

A smelt path is a unix path that is relative to `smelt-root`. In commands, the
bash variable `$SMELT_ROOT` will be present to interpret smelt paths.

### Project root

An alias for git root -- the path that is returned by
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Often in documentation and code, this will be
referred to as `$GIT_ROOT`

### Artifact

An artifact is a file that is generated from a command executing

### [Events][SmeltEvent]

Events are protobuf messages that are sent by the smelt runtime when tests are
executed that inform the state of execution for each command
