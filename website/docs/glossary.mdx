# Glossary

This is a reference for foundational concepts in smelt, that are used throughout
the codebase and documentation

### [Command][Command]

A command is the lowest level unit of work.

Each command describes:

- A bash script that describes all the work this command contains
- A `RuntimeRequirements` object to describe the CPU, memory, and timeout
requirements of this command
- A list of dependencies of other commands, that this command depends on

### [Target][Target]

A target is Python interface used to generate `Command`s. Each target can
generate up to three commands:

- the default command
- the re-run command -- is executed if the default command fails
- the rebuild command -- is executed prior to the re-run command if a dependent
target's re-run command fails

Test lists in smelt are composed of `Target`s, either yaml or Python.

### Project root (i.e. `$GIT_ROOT`)

An alias for git root -- the path that is returned by
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Often in documentation and code, this will be
referred to as `$GIT_ROOT`

### Artifact

An artifact is a file that is generated from a command executing.

### [Events][SmeltEvent]

Events are protobuf messages that are sent by the smelt runtime when tests are
executed. Events inform clients about the state of execution for each command.

### [Executors][Executors]

Executors are ...
